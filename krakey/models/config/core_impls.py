"""Core service slot overrides — let users replace built-in core
Engine implementations (memory, context, embedder, ...) with their own.

The user writes a dotted path in config.yaml; the EngineRegistry
imports it at startup, instantiates with runtime-supplied kwargs,
and validates the result satisfies the slot's Engine Protocol.
Empty / missing slots fall back to the built-in default impl.

The actual import + validation lives in
``krakey.engines.registry.EngineRegistry``; the per-slot Protocols
live under ``krakey.interfaces.engines.<slot>``.

Slot fields are ALL declared optional with empty-string defaults so
omitting the section in config.yaml is the same as opting in to the
built-in defaults across the board.
